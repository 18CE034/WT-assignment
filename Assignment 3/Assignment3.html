               Myself Pranay Jivrani, I'm currently pursuing computer engineering from Charotar University of Science and Technology.
                <br />
                I completed my Higher Secondary Education from Navrachna Vidyani Vidyalaya.
                <br />
                After B.Tech, I'm probably gonna be an entrepreneur as I find life very monotonous and entrepreneurship is something very challenging and where I can live my life on my own terms. 
                <br/>
                I love discovering music and I'm found of psychedelic art.

                “Music gives a soul to the universe, wings to the mind, flight to the imagination, and life to everything.” – Plato
                <br />
                Music affects our emotions. When we listen to sad songs, we tend to feel a decline in mood. When we listen to happy songs, we feel happier. Upbeat songs with energetic riffs and fast-paced rhythms (such as those we hear at sporting events) tend to make us excited and pumped up.
                Music is more than just sound, isn’t it? It’s movement, healing, connection, memory. It affects us in ways we might never fully comprehend. Maybe your favorite song has something more to say. What an amazing gift God has given us through music!
