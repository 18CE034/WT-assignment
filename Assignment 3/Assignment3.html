                I am currently enrolled as Second Year Student at Charotar University of Science and Technology pursuing Bachelor of Technology
                in Computer Engineering at Chandubhai S. Patel Inistitute of Technology under U & P U Patel Department of Computer Engineering.
                <br />
                I completed my Higher Secondary Education from Navrachna Vidyani Vidyalaya.
                <br />
                I love discovering music.

                “Music gives a soul to the universe, wings to the mind, flight to the imagination, and life to everything.” – Plato
                <br />
                Music affects our emotions. When we listen to sad songs, we tend to feel a decline in mood. When we listen to happy songs, we feel happier. Upbeat songs with energetic riffs and fast-paced rhythms (such as those we hear at sporting events) tend to make us excited and pumped up.
                Music is more than just sound, isn’t it? It’s movement, healing, connection, memory. It affects us in ways we might never fully comprehend. Maybe your favorite song has something more to say. What an amazing gift God has given us through music!
